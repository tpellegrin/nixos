# Personal NixOS Configuration

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration files. I use NixOS as my primary operating system and manage my system configuration declaratively using Nix and NixOS modules.

## Contents

- `configuration.nix`: Main NixOS configuration file where system-wide settings and packages are defined.
- `hardware-configuration.nix`: Generated file containing hardware-specific configuration. This file is generated by NixOS during installation.
- `services.nix`: File defining system services and configurations for NixOS, including desktop environment, printing, audio, virtualization, and containerization support.
- `home-manager/home.nix`: User-specific configuration managed by home-manager, including home directory setup, user packages, and customizations.
- `flake.nix`: Flakes definition for managing the NixOS configuration.
- `overlays/`: Directory containing Nix overlays used for customizing packages or adding extra functionality.
- `modules/nixos/`: Custom NixOS modules for organizing system-wide configuration.
- `modules/home-manager/`: Custom Home Manager modules for organizing user-specific configuration.
