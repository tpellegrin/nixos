# Personal NixOS Configuration

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration files. I use NixOS as my primary operating system and manage my system configuration declaratively using Nix and NixOS modules.

## Contents

- `configuration.nix`: Main NixOS configuration file where system-wide settings and packages are defined.
- `hardware-configuration.nix`: Generated file containing hardware-specific configuration. This file is generated by NixOS during installation.
- `TODO: Add home.nix`: User-specific configuration, including home directory setup, user packages, and customizations.
- `TODO: Add flake.nix`: Flakes definition for managing the NixOS configuration as a flake.
- `TODO: Add overlays/`: Directory containing Nix overlays used for customizing packages or adding extra functionality.
- `TODO: Add modules/`: Custom NixOS modules for organizing configuration.

## Usage

### Applying Configuration

To apply the configuration, run:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
